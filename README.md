# pi-goal-x

> **Fork of [@capyup/pi-goal](https://github.com/capyup/pi-goal)** — this repository extends the upstream with quality-of-life features for the completion auditor, lifecycle reliability improvements, mid-flight objective updates, deferred archival, and drafting UX refinements. Upstream changes can be merged from the original repository.

`pi-goal-x` is a long-running goal extension for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent). It gives the agent a durable objective, a visible lifecycle, and schema-gated tools for drafting, executing, pausing, resuming, and completing work.

The extension is designed around one rule: **the user owns intent; the agent executes only after the goal is explicit and confirmed**.

## What's different from upstream

All core features of [@capyup/pi-goal](https://github.com/capyup/pi-goal) are preserved. The following changes are specific to pi-goal-x:

### Verification contract system

- **Per-goal verification contracts** — when drafting a goal, include a `Verification contract:` section with plain-text requirements (e.g. "Run npm test (0 failures), grep for remaining STP references"). The contract is extracted, stored on the goal record, and enforced by the `complete_goal` tool — the call is rejected unless the agent provides a non-empty `verificationSummary` matching the contract.
- **Per-task verification contracts** — `propose_task_list` supports an optional `verificationContract` per task. If set, `complete_task` requires a non-empty `verificationSummary`.
- **Both prompt and tool enforcement** — prompts include a VERIFICATION CONTRACT section instructing the agent; tool validators reject calls that violate the contract.
- **Backward compatible** — goals/tasks without a `Verification contract:` section work exactly as before. No contract = no enforcement.
- **Auditor integration** — the independent completion auditor receives both the `verificationContract` and `verificationSummary` and cross-checks claims against real artifacts.
- **`complete_goal` `testResults` removed** — replaced with `verificationSummary`. The old structured test results interface is gone.

### Unified goal + task acceptance

- **Single-dialog confirmation** — `propose_goal_draft` now accepts an optional `tasks` array parameter. The confirmation dialog shows the goal objective AND the proposed task list together in a single rich TUI view with box-drawing panel (`┌─ TASKS ───┐`), section headers, and hierarchical indentation for subtasks.
- **Atomic creation** — one confirmation (single enter press) creates the goal AND its task list together. No need for separate `propose_goal_draft` + `propose_task_list` calls.
- **Backward compatible** — existing separate `propose_task_list` flow continues to work unchanged. Goals without tasks work as before.

### Task list & sub-task system

- **Structured task breakdown** — the agent can propose a task list via `propose_task_list` (standalone) or `propose_goal_draft` with `tasks` (unified). Both show a Confirm / Continue Chatting dialog. Once confirmed, tasks are displayed in prompts, the widget, serialized to disk, and included in auditor review.
- **Recursive subtasks** — tasks can have nested sub-tasks via `subtasks?: GoalTask[]` (full recursive type). Subtask depth is controlled globally by `subtaskDepth` in `.pi/pi-goal-x-settings.json` (default: 1 level). Too-deep subtrees are rejected at proposal.
- **Lightweight subtasks** — each task has an optional `lightweightSubtasks?: boolean` flag. When true, the parent can complete regardless of subtask status. When false/absent (full subtasks), all subtasks must be individually complete before the parent can close.
- **Per-task completion** — `complete_task` marks individual tasks done with optional evidence/verificationSummary, and `skip_task` marks tasks as skipped with a required reason. Neither stops the turn, so the agent can continue uninterrupted.
- **Recursive lookup** — `findTaskInTree` and `updateTaskInTree` search and update tasks at any depth. Subtask IDs are valid targets for `complete_task` and `skip_task`.
- **Subtask gate** — parent tasks with full subtasks require all sub-items to be completed or skipped before the parent can close, enforced by recursive `checkSubtasksComplete`.
- **Duplicate ID validation** — `validateTaskListProposal` recursively checks all task IDs across the entire tree, preventing collisions between parent/subtask or sibling subtasks.
- **Agent workflow guidance** — prompts include a `[TASK WORKFLOW]` section directing agents to use tasks as progress trackers, completing subtasks immediately when work finishes (not batch-marking at the end).
- **Hierarchical display** — task lists with subtasks render with indentation in prompts (`taskListBlock`, `goalPrompt`, `continuationPrompt`) and in the TUI widget (recursive count, BFS next-pending).
- **Optional `taskList`** — goals without a task list work exactly as before. The feature is entirely opt-in.
- **Soft `complete_goal` gate** — when `blockCompletion: true` is set, `complete_goal` surfaces a warning if pending tasks remain (prompt-level only; the agent can still complete).

### Goal objective is immutable

- The goal objective is immutable — the agent **must not** modify it autonomously. Objective changes are only possible through `propose_goal_tweak`, which presents the user with a Confirm / Continue Chatting dialog matching the `propose_goal_draft` confirmation pattern. This prevents the agent from silently changing the goal contract.
- **`propose_goal_tweak`** is the sole mechanism for updating the objective, available exclusively during a `/goal-tweak` drafting flow. If the user's requirements change, they must run `/goal-tweak` to initiate the revision flow.

### Deferred archival

- **No more premature archiving**: previously, `update_goal` archived the goal file inline within the tool handler before the agent could see the audit result (or skip notification). Archival is now deferred until `turn_end` — after the agent has received the audit/skip result in the conversation. The goal remains visible in the active pool through the entire completion flow.
- **Cleaner lifecycle**: completed goals are archived by the `turn_end` lifecycle hook, not by the tool handler. The `accountProgress` guard skips disk reconciliation for completed goals.

### E2e test infrastructure

- **Deterministic fork tests using `--mode json`**: the e2e suite spawns a real `pi --fork --mode json` session, parses structured `tool_execution_start`/`tool_execution_end` JSON events for field-level assertions — no free-text AI output parsing. Uses `--append-system-prompt` + `--tools` to force deterministic tool calls.
- **Full coverage**: 310 tests total — function-level integration tests, mock-pi handler tests, file-validity checks, real `pi --fork --mode json` E2E tests, propose_goal_tweak unit/integration/e2e tests, task list policy/round-trip/render tests (including subtasks), and verification contract tests.

### Completion auditor

- **Live progress widget** — when the auditor runs, the TUI shows a spinner, a progress bar (`[████░░░░] 40%`), step labels (`Inspecting files...`, `Verifying success criteria...`), the current tool being executed, and recent output lines. No more wondering if anything is happening.
- **Per-goal auditor toggle** — during goal confirmation, press `a` to toggle the auditor on/off for that goal. The toggle uses a ●/○ indicator between the goal summary and confirm options. The default position comes from settings; the per-goal override persists within the session.
- **Escape to skip** — press Escape during an audit to abort it and complete the goal immediately. The skip is recorded in the ledger as `audit_skipped` with reason `user_aborted` and auditor model metadata.
- **Disable the auditor entirely** — set `disabled: true` in `.pi/pi-goal-x-settings.json` (or toggle it via `/goal-settings`). The agent can still bypass with user confirmation by passing `confirmBypassAuditor: true` to `complete_goal`.
- **Skipped audits are recorded** — every skip (whether disabled or Escape-aborted) is logged to the ledger with the reason, provider, model, and thinking level for full traceability.
- **Robust abort detection** — the auditor detects aborts both from exceptions *and* from `session.prompt()` returning after an abort signal, preventing stuck goals or ghost states.
- **Cleaner lifecycle** — `AbortSignal` is properly wired to `session.abort()`, animation timers are cleaned up, and the unsubscribe path is always executed. No more having to kill the session.
- **Completion report includes full auditor output** — the auditor's full report is included in the goal completion conversation message upon approval, not just a verdict.
- **Session factory injection** — `runGoalCompletionAuditor` accepts an optional `createSession` parameter for testability, enabling mock auditor sessions in tests.
- **Structured test evidence** — the executor can pass `testResults` (exit code, suite name, output, timestamp) via `complete_goal({testResults})`. The auditor receives a `<test_evidence>` block and is instructed to check it before re-running test suites, skipping redundant re-runs.

### Drafting & UX

- **Normalized proposal-refinement language** — consistent terminology ("keep refining through normal proposal cycles") across all drafting prompts and tools.
- **`PI_GOAL_AUTO_CONFIRM=0` opt-out** — explicitly set the env var to `0` to disable auto-confirm even in headless contexts (useful for benchmarking).

### Testing

- **Comprehensive abort/skip coverage** — unit tests for `audit_skipped` ledger events, disabled auditor config, Esc-to-skip widget behaviour, post-prompt abort detection, and the `confirmBypassAuditor` parameter.

## What it provides

- **Two goal styles**: regular goals for open-ended work, and Sisyphus goals for patient ordered execution.
- **Intent-before-run flow**: `/goals` and `/sisyphus` start a discussion where the agent can clarify, research, and grill before any work begins.
- **Direct set flow**: `/goals-set` and `/sisyphus-set` immediately create and start a goal from the supplied objective.
- **Confirm-before-commit for discussions**: the agent must call `propose_goal_draft`; the user confirms or keeps chatting.
- **Full goal visibility**: after confirmation, the final objective is printed back into the conversation in full.
- **Multiple open goals**: `.pi/goals/` may hold several active goal files at once; each pi session focuses exactly one goal at a time.
- **Session-local focus**: the focused goal id is stored as a branch-local session entry, not in goal markdown metadata.
- **Auto-continue loop**: confirmed goals can continue across turns until completion, pause, abort, user interruption, or the empty-turn guard.
- **Schema gates**: unsafe lifecycle transitions are rejected by tool validators, not just prompts.
- **Sisyphus as a light variant**: Sisyphus shares the normal lifecycle/tools and differs only in prompt style and completion standard.
- **Pause/resume/abort/clear lifecycle**: goals can be paused by the user, paused by the agent when blocked, resumed, completed from pause, aborted, or archived.
- **Disk-backed state**: active and archived goals are stored under `.pi/goals/`.
- **Lightweight built-in questionnaire tools**: `goal_question` and `goal_questionnaire` let the agent ask structured drafting questions without depending on another package.
- **Above-editor status widget**: pi shows the current goal, status, progress, and active file path while work is running.

## Install

From npm:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-goal-x
```

From a local checkout:

```bash
pi install .
```

Try once without installing:

```bash
pi -e .
```

## Quick start

### Regular goal

```text
/goals add structured logging to the auth module
```

Flow:

1. The agent clarifies, researches, or grills only when the goal contract needs it.
2. The agent calls `propose_goal_draft` with a concrete objective once the contract is clear.
3. pi shows a full plain-text confirmation report.
4. If confirmed, the full finalized goal is printed into the conversation and written to `.pi/goals/`.
5. The new goal becomes this session's focus. Existing open goals remain in `.pi/goals/` and can be selected later with `/goal-focus`.
6. The agent works only on the focused goal until it calls `update_goal(status="complete")`, pauses, aborts, produces an empty/non-progress turn, or the user interrupts.

### Sisyphus goal

```text
/sisyphus Refactor the auth flow: 1) extract token validation. 2) wire it into login. 3) update tests.
```

Sisyphus mode is for patient ordered execution. It uses the same lifecycle and tools as a regular goal; the difference is the prompt style and completion standard: preserve the user's order, do not rush, do not invent preflight/reconnaissance steps, and stop to ask when blocked.

If the objective is already final and should start immediately, use:

```text
/goals-set add structured logging to the auth module
/sisyphus-set Refactor auth flow exactly as ordered: 1) extract token validation. 2) wire it into login. 3) update tests.
```

## User commands

```text
/goals <topic>          Discuss/research/grill a regular goal, then confirm a draft
/sisyphus <topic>       Discuss/grill a Sisyphus-style goal, then confirm a draft
/goals-set <objective>  Immediately create and start a regular goal
/sisyphus-set <objective> Immediately create and start a Sisyphus-style goal
/goal-status            Show focused goal state
/goal-list              List all open goals in .pi/goals/
/goal-focus             Choose this session's focused goal
/goal-tweak <change>    Draft a revision to the focused active/paused goal
/goal-pause             Pause the focused active goal
/goal-resume            Resume a paused goal
/goal-settings          Configure pi-goal settings, including auditor model settings
/goal-abort             Abort/archive the focused goal or cancel drafting
/goal-clear             Archive the focused goal or cancel drafting
```

Pressing `Esc` or aborting an active run pauses the goal so it does not remain falsely active.

## Multiple open goals and focus

`pi-goal` separates durable goals from session focus:

- **Goal pool**: every open goal is an `active_goal_*.md` file under `.pi/goals/`.
- **Focused goal**: the current pi session has one focused goal id stored in a `pi-goal-focus` custom session entry.
- **No focus in markdown**: goal files describe the goal itself; they do not record which session is focused on them.
- **Branch-local focus**: because focus is reconstructed from the current session branch, `/tree` navigation can restore a different focus for a different branch.
- **One continuation chain**: auto-continue only schedules work for the focused goal in the current session.

Creating a goal with `/goals`, `/sisyphus`, `/goals-set`, or `/sisyphus-set` no longer clears other open goals. It creates a new active goal file and focuses it. Use `/goal-list` to inspect open goals and `/goal-focus` to switch the session focus. If the latest focus entry explicitly clears focus, or points at a missing/stale goal, a remaining single open goal is not auto-focused; single-open auto-focus only happens when no focus entry exists at all. If multiple open goals exist and the session has no valid focus, `/goal-resume`, `/goal-clear`, `/goal-abort`, `/goal-pause`, and `/goal-tweak` ask the user to choose a goal instead of acting on all of them.

## Agent tools

The extension exposes tools only when they make sense for the current lifecycle phase.

| Tool | Visible when | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `goal_question` | drafting / tweak drafting | Ask one focused user question |
| `goal_questionnaire` | drafting / tweak drafting | Ask multiple structured questions |
| `get_goal` | always | Read the focused goal state; mentions other open goals when present |
| `propose_goal_draft` | drafting only (goal creation) | Submit a concrete draft for user confirmation |
| `propose_goal_tweak` | tweak drafting only | Submit a revision to an existing goal (shows Confirm / Continue Chatting dialog) |
| `complete_goal` | focused active or paused goal | Mark the focused goal complete — supply a `verificationSummary` covering all contract items. When the auditor is disabled, supply `confirmBypassAuditor: true` after user confirmation to bypass the audit |
| `pause_goal` | focused active goal | Pause the focused goal because of a real blocker |
| `abort_goal` | focused active or paused goal | Abort/archive an obsolete, impossible, unsafe, or user-cancelled focused goal |
| `propose_task_list` | active or paused goal | Propose a structured task list for user confirmation (stops the turn) |
| `complete_task` | active or paused goal | Mark a task complete with optional `verificationSummary`. If the task has a `verificationContract`, the summary is required (does not stop turn) |
| `skip_task` | active or paused goal | Mark a task skipped with a required reason (does not stop turn) |
| `propose_goal_tweak` | tweak drafting only | Submit a revision to the focused goal (shows Confirm / Continue Chatting dialog) |
| `step_complete` | hidden / legacy | Compatibility no-op; Sisyphus no longer requires a step counter |
| `create_goal` | hidden | Direct calls are rejected; normal creation goes through `propose_goal_draft` |

## Drafting behavior

`/goals` and `/sisyphus` start a lightweight intent discussion, not a heavy runtime sub-state. The agent clarifies, researches, and grills only when needed, may proceed directly for fully specified requests, and then calls `propose_goal_draft` to show the user a Confirm / Continue Chatting dialog. `goal_question` and `goal_questionnaire` are available when structured input helps, but plain conversation is acceptable.

`/goals-set` and `/sisyphus-set` skip the discussion and confirmation dialog. They directly create and focus an active goal from the supplied objective so execution can begin immediately.

The agent may do minimal read-only reconnaissance when it directly improves the goal contract, but should not begin substantive implementation before confirmation. The strict runtime starts after the user confirms the draft and an active goal is created.

When a draft is proposed, the confirmation UI shows a full plain-text report with draft details, the original topic, and the proposed goal. If the confirmation UI throws in interactive mode, creation fails closed and confirmation remains active; it never auto-creates a goal. When a draft is confirmed, the tool result includes the full final objective, not a one-line summary, and normal work tools (`write`, `read`, `bash`, `edit`) are available for execution. This makes the confirmed contract visible in the conversation as well as on disk.

While goal confirmation or tweak drafting is active, old goal execution is suspended: active-goal prompts, accounting, and auto-continue checkpoints do not run for the previously focused goal.

## Completion behavior

Completion is also explicit and is checked by an independent pi auditor agent. The executor calls `update_goal` with its completion claim:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "completionSummary": "What was completed and what evidence proves it."
}
```

Before archiving the goal, `update_goal` starts a separate pi agent in an isolated in-memory session. The auditor receives the objective, the executor's completion claim, and current goal metadata, then can inspect the workspace with read-only-oriented tools (`read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, and `bash`). It must end its report with exactly one marker:

- `<approved/>` archives the goal as complete.
- `<disapproved/>`, no marker, an error, or an abort rejects completion and leaves the goal open.

The auditor is semantic, not a paperwork checklist: it should reject scaffold-only, alpha, generated-template, proxy-metric, build-only, or weakly verified completions when the real user outcome is not satisfied.

By default the auditor uses the current/default pi model. Configure it via `.pi/pi-goal-x-settings.json`, or interactively with `/goal-settings` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

The completion result prints a full report into the conversation:

- `Goal complete.`
- optional completion summary / evidence supplied by the executor
- the auditor's approval report
- full current goal details, including objective, status, usage, mode, and file path

Sisyphus goals use the same completion tool as regular goals. The stricter part is the prompt/criteria standard: the agent should only call completion after the whole ordered objective is actually satisfied and likely to survive independent auditing. A paused goal can also be completed directly when the agent already has enough evidence that every requirement is satisfied; it does not need a resume just to call `complete_goal`.

## Schema gates

The shipped gates are intentionally small and mechanical.

| Gate | Prevents |
|---|---|
| Focus consistency | `/goals` accidentally becoming Sisyphus, or `/sisyphus` becoming regular mode |
| Confirm-before-commit | The agent silently creating or replacing a discussion-based goal |
| Direct set intent | `/goals-set` and `/sisyphus-set` are explicit user shortcuts that bypass draft confirmation |
| Completion auditor gate | Archiving completion unless an independent pi auditor agent returns `<approved/>` |
| Abort gate | Aborting missing, stale, completed, or reasonless goals |
| Direct-create rejection | Hidden `create_goal` calls creating goals without the confirmation flow |
| Post-stop block | Continuing to call tools after `pause_goal`, `abort_goal`, `complete_goal`, or `propose_goal_tweak` stops the turn |
| Empty-turn guard | Pure chat loops that would keep auto-continuing without meaningful goal work |
| Abort pause | Active goals staying active after user abort / Ctrl-C |
| Disk reconciliation | External pause/archive/delete/status changes being ignored or overwritten by stale memory |
| Post-compaction reminder | Losing the active objective after session compaction |

## Files

```text
.pi/goals/active_goal_<timestamp>_<id>.md
.pi/goals/archived/goal_<timestamp>_<id>.md
```

Multiple `active_goal_*.md` files may exist simultaneously. This is the project-level open goal pool. The selected/focused goal is intentionally not stored in these files; focus lives in session custom state.

Each file contains:

1. extension-owned JSON metadata;
2. a user-editable `# Goal Prompt` section;
3. progress/status information.

Before commands, tools, and lifecycle hooks act on a focused goal, the runtime reconciles the focused record against the active goal file on disk. External archive/delete/status changes therefore win over stale in-memory state and cannot resurrect deleted active files. Prompt-body edits are still picked up from the `# Goal Prompt` section; focus is never stored in goal markdown.

Goal paths are constrained to `.pi/goals/` and `.pi/goals/archived/`; absolute paths, traversal, NUL bytes, symlinks, and unsafe metadata paths are rejected.

## Configuration

All settings live in a single file: **`.pi/pi-goal-x-settings.json`**

Configured interactively via `/goal-settings`, or edited directly:

```json
{
  "disableTasks": false,
  "disableContracts": false,
  "subtaskDepth": 1,
  "provider": "fireworks",
  "model": "accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-v4-flash",
  "thinkingLevel": "high",
  "disabled": false
}
```

| Field | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `disableTasks` | `false` | Suppress task list features entirely when `true` |
| `disableContracts` | `false` | Suppress verification contract enforcement when `true` |
| `subtaskDepth` | `1` | Maximum nesting depth for subtasks |
| `provider` | system default | Provider name for the auditor agent |
| `model` | system default | Model name for the auditor agent |
| `thinkingLevel` | system default | Thinking level: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| `disabled` | `false` | When `true`, skip the completion audit entirely |

**Env var overrides:**
- `PI_GOAL_DISABLE_TASKS=1` — disable task features (takes precedence over file)
- `PI_GOAL_DISABLE_CONTRACTS=1` — disable contract enforcement (takes precedence over file)
- `PI_GOAL_SETTINGS_FILE=custom-path.json` — alternative settings file path (relative to cwd or absolute)

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `PI_GOAL_AUTO_CONFIRM` | unset | When `1`, auto-confirms drafts in headless/test contexts |
| `PI_GOAL_DISABLE_TASKS` | — | When `1`, disable task features (overrides settings file) |
| `PI_GOAL_DISABLE_CONTRACTS` | — | When `1`, disable contract enforcement (overrides settings file) |
| `PI_GOAL_SETTINGS_FILE` | `.pi/pi-goal-x-settings.json` | Alternative settings file path (relative to cwd or absolute) |

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run check
npm pack --dry-run
```

The fast unit suite uses Node's built-in test runner and covers core parsing, drafting gates, lifecycle policy, abort policy, questionnaire formatting, centralized tool names, Sisyphus prompt-style behavior, completion reporting, and display helpers.

The experiment harness under `experiments/` runs full pi sessions against real model calls and mechanical rubrics.

```bash
cd experiments
bash harness/run.sh C1-vague-goal-set --count 3 --grade --no-smoke
```

## Design principles

- **User owns intent**: only the user starts, replaces, resumes, clears, or confirms goals; the agent may only pause, complete, or abort through schema-gated lifecycle tools with evidence/reason.
- **One commit path**: normal goal creation goes through drafting and confirmation.
- **Schema beats prompt walls**: recurring failure modes are handled by validators and tool-call interceptors.
- **Visible contracts**: confirmed goals and completion reports are printed fully into the conversation.
- **Lifecycle-shaped tool surface**: the agent sees only tools appropriate to the current phase.
- **Disk-backed continuity**: goal state survives context churn and can be audited from `.pi/goals/`.
- **Human-owned focus**: the agent may work on the focused goal, but only user commands/UI selection switch focus.

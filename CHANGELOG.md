## [0.8.2] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **Goal archival deferred until after agent turn completes**: previously, `update_goal` archived the goal file inline within the tool handler before the agent could see the audit result (or skip notification). Now the goal is marked complete in-memory and written as an active file (not archived) during `update_goal`, and archival happens at `turn_end` — after the agent has received the audit/skip result.

### Added

- **`buildCompletionReport` supports `auditSkippedReason`**: skip notifications (disabled auditor, Esc abort) are now included in the tool output text, ensuring the agent sees why the audit was skipped before the goal is archived.
- **Tests**: verify `writeActiveGoalFile` no longer auto-archives for complete status (deferred archival), and `buildCompletionReport` correctly handles `auditSkippedReason` with precedence over `auditorReport`.

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-05-19

### Changed

- **Audit log messages clarified**: `extensions/goal.ts` — disabled/aborted audit messages now read naturally as goal completion notices ("Goal completed — auditor disabled in settings." / "Goal completed — auditor bypassed (user pressed Escape during audit).").

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **C19 iteration-frustration benchmark**: new spec under `specs/` exercising the proposal-refinement cycle with repeated rejection scenarios.
- Spec metadata files: `PRODUCT.md`, `TECH.md`, `MILESTONES.md` for the C19 benchmark.

### Changed

- **Normalized proposal-refinement cycle language**: `extensions/goal-draft.ts`, `extensions/goal-questionnaire.ts`, and `extensions/goal.ts` — consistent terminology across the drafting/refinement pipeline.
- Updated test assertions (`tests/goal-draft.test.ts`) to match the new language.

---

## [0.7.2] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- Gallery image metadata and placeholder screenshot for `pi.dev/packages`.

---

## [0.7.1] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Version metadata in package manifest after 0.7.0 release commit.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Goal auditor lifecycle** (`feat(auditor)`):
  - `disabled` config flag to turn off auditing entirely.
  - Real-time progress callbacks during audit execution.
  - `audit_skipped` event type recorded in the ledger with reason + auditor metadata.
- **Auditor progress widget**: live spinner, tool tracking, and skip hint in the TUI.
- **Auditor integration**:
  - Escape-key handling during audit (skip with Esc, prevents cascading goal pause).
  - `createSession` factory wiring `AbortSignal` to `session.abort()`.
  - Audit abort detection (both thrown and non-thrown `session.prompt` aborts).
  - Goal completes on audit abort instead of leaving an open state.

### Fixed

- Audit cancellation loop: `confirmBypassAuditor` param respected, skip-once with `triggerTurn` mirroring disabled-bypass path.
- Corrected Esc-to-skip widget message to reflect actual behavior.

### Tests

- Unit tests for disabled config, `audit_skipped` events, and widget skip hint.
- Abort-scenario tests for `runGoalCompletionAuditor`.
- Post-prompt abort detection test.
- Goal policy test validating completion report includes full auditor output.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Goal runtime updates — internal refactoring and lifecycle improvements.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-12

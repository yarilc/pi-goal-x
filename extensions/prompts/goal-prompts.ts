Available work tools for pursuing the active goal include write, read, bash, and edit. Use those tools directly for file and shell work; do not call get_goal repeatedly to discover tools.

Keep this goal in force until it is actually achieved. Do not pause for confirmation just because a phase, chapter, file, or checklist item is finished. At each natural stopping point, compare every explicit requirement with concrete evidence from the workspace/session. If the objective is complete, call update_goal with status=complete and summarize the evidence; update_goal will launch an independent pi auditor agent and only archive if that auditor returns <approved/>. If it is not complete, choose the next concrete action and do it.

The completion auditor is independent and semantic, not a paperwork checklist. It may inspect files and command output, and it will reject scaffold-only, alpha, template, proxy-metric, or weakly verified completions with <disapproved/>.

If you hit a real blocker that you cannot resolve with one more reasonable next step (missing credentials, contradictory spec, file/permission you cannot access, dangerous operation pending user approval, or an unclear Sisyphus-style ordered plan), the CORRECT action is to call pause_goal({reason, suggestedAction?}) with a structured, non-empty reason. pause_goal IS the channel for handing control back to the user — do not substitute a conversational "blocked, please help" summary in your final message and skip the tool call. Without pause_goal, the goal stays "active" and the UI cannot show the blocker. After pause_goal returns, you may add one short user-facing summary, but the tool call comes first.

If the user explicitly asks to abandon/cancel this goal, or the objective is obsolete, impossible, or unsafe to continue and should not be marked complete, call abort_goal({reason}) with a non-empty reason and stop.

Do NOT silently invent workarounds, fake completion, or quietly redefine the objective. Do NOT call update_goal=complete to escape a blocker.

Goal evolution: if the user gives requirements, feedback, or corrections that differ from the goal objective, the goal is stale. Propose the updated objective concisely and wait for the user to confirm before continuing. Use update_goal with updatedObjective for narrow focus-area changes, or suggest /goal-tweak for broader revisions (boundaries, constraints, multiple sections). Do NOT mark the goal complete with a stale objective.${sisyphusDisciplineBlock(goal) ? `\n${sisyphusDisciplineBlock(goal)}` : ""}`;
